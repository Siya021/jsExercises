/* 
1. Variable 
- A variable is simply a name to which a value can be assigned, it can be changed and not fixed.

2. Value
- These are values that are made of values like Booleans, Strings, arrays, and numbers

3. Data Type 
- Data types define the type of data that a variable can store, there are primitive(string, number, boolean, undefined, null, and symbol) and non-primitive(object) data types.

4. Initialization
- to set a value to a variable then use the assignment operator (=)

5. Difference between let, var, const
- let and var create a variable that can be reassigned other values while const creates a constant variable that cannot be reassignned other values

6. Variable Scope
- its the value of code which determines the accessibility of variables.

7. Loops
for = when you want to iterate over maps and when you want to work with break, continue and return.
while = when you don't know the number of iterations ahead of time.
forEach = whenever your array is associative
